PHOTON SERVER IS ACTING A BIT STRANGE: ADDED A RECONNECT FUNCTION BECAUSE IT WAS MESSING UP. YOU MIGHT HAVE TO CLICK THE CREATE OR JOIN A FEW TIMES IF IT DOESN'T WORK AT FIRST. FUCK KNOWS WHATS HAPPENING :(

The third version of the monopoly game code. Includes:

1. 2 player moving around board
2. A turn function that waits till the other player has moved
3. A function that automatically buys property of player who lands on it, placing either a red or blue circle to indicate who landed
4. UI texts to tell the players their money and who brought property ect..
5. A passGo function
6. Multiplayer functionality
7. Lobby, loading and game screen

IMPORTANT: You'll need unity to run the code, just import the package once you've opened a project. You will also need virtual studio code to access the C# files


The dice in the center of the board is clickable and moves each player. It will not be accessible to a specific player until the other has moved.


Other things to work on:

1. 3D physics dice and code
2. Doubles roll and maybe when roll double twice = goToPrison function
3. Nice background and imported designs and stuff
4. Definatley need ui boxes for END TURN and BUY PROPERTY to let a player choose if they wish to end their turn or buy stuff

If you have any questions about the code just message me on WhatsApp :)
