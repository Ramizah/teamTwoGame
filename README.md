# teamTwoGame

The First version of the monopoly game code. Includes:

1. working node pathway for player movement around board
2. 2 Dice functions that rolls 1 - 12 
3. 3 players take turns rolling Dice

IMPORTANT: You'll need unity to run the code, just import the package once you've opened a project. You will also need virtual studio code to access the C# files

The dice in the center of the board is clickable and moves each player. It takes around 2 seconds for each player to move.

Also The code needs muliplayer functionality so thats on the todo list.

Other things:

1. 3D physics dice
2. Doubles roll and maybe when roll double twice = goToPrison functuon
3. A log in and setup page
4. Nice background and imported designs and stuff

If you have any questions about the code just message me on WhatsApp :)
