Photon Server is now more stable. Hopefully

Latest Verson 3.3 of monopoly:

1. 2 player moving around board
2. A turn function that waits till the other player has moved
3. A function that Allows players to buys property of player who lands on it, placing either a red or blue circle to indicate who landed
4. UI texts to tell the players their money and who brought property ect..
5. A passGo function
6. Multiplayer functionality
7. Lobby, loading and game screen
8. Ui and Function to let player choose whether they wish to buy property
9. UI showing street name landed on, its cost and colour set
10. Function that causes player who lands on opposing property to pay specified rent

QUALITY OF LIFE CHANGES:

1.Added function that does not allow turn until all players are in room
2.Added a leave game function that sends player back to lobby. However,have not yet implemented rejoin.
3. Added funciton that prevents user from making same room name HOWEVER NEED TO STOP ERROR MESSAGES FROM SHOWING
4. Added Internet checks for loading and Lobby screen that debug print status. For players who are wondering whether they have internet
5. Added a disconnect reconnect function in case join or create does not work first time


IMPORTANT: You'll need unity to run the code, just import the package once you've opened a project. You will also need virtual studio code to access the C# files


Other things to work on:

1. 3D physics dice and code
2. Doubles roll and maybe when roll double twice = goToPrison function
3. Nice background and imported designs and stuff
4. Definatley need ui boxes for END TURN and BUY PROPERTY to let a player choose if they wish to end their turn or buy stuff

If you have any questions about the code just message me on WhatsApp :)
